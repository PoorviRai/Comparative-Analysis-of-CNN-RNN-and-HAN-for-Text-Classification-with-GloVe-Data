9,cv926,18471,47,"the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory .",neg

9,cv926,18471,51,"well , i imagine he didn't have one .",neg
9,cv926,18471,52,that's why he feels like a plot device .,neg
9,cv926,18471,53,"this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) .",neg
9,cv926,18471,54,"obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting .",neg
9,cv926,18471,55,"mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere .",neg
9,cv926,18471,56,"since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie .",neg
9,cv926,18471,57,"things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role .",neg
9,cv926,18471,58,i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting .,neg
9,cv926,18471,59,"and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving .",neg
9,cv926,18471,60,"also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written .",neg

9,cv926,18471,65,"i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film .",neg
9,cv926,18471,66,but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome .,neg
9,cv926,18471,67,"my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away .",neg
9,cv926,18471,68,can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ?,neg
9,cv926,18471,69,i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours .,neg
9,cv926,18471,70,and then there's the question of magic .,neg
9,cv926,18471,71,what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ?,neg
9,cv926,18471,72,i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel .,neg
9,cv926,18471,73,"john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction .",neg
9,cv926,18471,74,i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here .,neg

9,cv926,18471,76,and what about the ridiculous expectations ?,neg
9,cv926,18471,77,"mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects .",neg
9,cv926,18471,78,"instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show .",neg
9,cv926,18471,79,"i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't .",neg

9,cv943,23547,7,"now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through .",neg

9,cv943,23547,16,i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime .,neg
9,cv943,23547,17,i will just mention one final flaw .,neg

9,cv944,15042,22,"interestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick .",neg

9,cv950,13478,18,"we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of "" that thing you do !

9,cv950,13478,21,"since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile .",neg

9,cv950,13478,27,"we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ?",neg
9,cv950,13478,28,"but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities .",neg
9,cv950,13478,29,"generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) .",neg
9,cv950,13478,30,"i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost .",neg
9,cv950,13478,31,"and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film .",neg
9,cv950,13478,32,"however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about .",neg
9,cv950,13478,33,"she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone .",neg
9,cv950,13478,34,she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters .,neg
9,cv950,13478,35,"she may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves "" well , at least we'll be entertained . """,neg
9,cv950,13478,36,"a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try .",neg
9,cv950,13478,37,"basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .",neg
9,cv950,13478,38,"we don't feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots .",neg
9,cv950,13478,39,the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ?,neg

9,cv975,11920,13,"although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .",neg
9,cv975,11920,14,"rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women .",neg

9,cv975,11920,16,"no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling .",neg

9,cv975,11920,27,"but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical .",neg
9,cv975,11920,28,"the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .",neg
9,cv975,11920,29,"because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .",neg

9,cv975,11920,31,"consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost .",neg
9,cv975,11920,32,the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind .,neg
9,cv975,11920,33,"despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .",neg

9,cv975,11920,37,"the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own .",neg
9,cv975,11920,38,"if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .",neg
9,cv975,11920,39,"maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .",neg
9,cv975,11920,40,"the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance .",neg
9,cv975,11920,41,"spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him .",neg
9,cv975,11920,42,"of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .",neg

9,cv978,22192,22,even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia .,neg
9,cv978,22192,23,we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe .,neg

9,cv979,2029,2,"unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world .",neg

9,cv979,2029,4,"the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves .",neg

9,cv979,2029,13,"neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable .",neg
9,cv979,2029,14,perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .,neg
9,cv979,2029,15,"this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre .",neg
9,cv979,2029,16,"much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre .",neg
9,cv979,2029,17,"chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever .",neg
9,cv979,2029,18,"scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .",neg
9,cv979,2029,19,perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .,neg
9,cv979,2029,20,"the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .",neg
9,cv979,2029,21,"mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) .",neg
9,cv979,2029,22,the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .,neg
9,cv979,2029,23,"the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .",neg
9,cv979,2029,24,the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .,neg
9,cv979,2029,25,"he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting .",neg

9,cv980,11851,11,"the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .",neg
9,cv980,11851,12,"the actors and directing don't help , either .",neg
9,cv980,11851,13,"hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .",neg

9,cv980,11851,18,"the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .",neg
9,cv980,11851,19,"the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )",neg

9,cv980,11851,26,"the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess .",neg
9,cv980,11851,27,"there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .",neg
9,cv980,11851,28,"i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .",neg
9,cv980,11851,29,"but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .",neg
9,cv980,11851,30,"finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .",neg
9,cv980,11851,31,levison can't handle his own plot .,neg
9,cv980,11851,32,"it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .",neg
9,cv980,11851,33,"and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )",neg
9,cv980,11851,34,it's not all that bad though .,neg
9,cv980,11851,35,"the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .",neg

9,cv980,11851,38,overall rating= review by david wilcock,neg
9,cv981,16679,0,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up .",neg
9,cv981,16679,1,"everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through .",neg
9,cv981,16679,2,""" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day .",neg
9,cv981,16679,3,"inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper .",neg
9,cv981,16679,4,"soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message .",neg
9,cv981,16679,5,"of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner .",neg
9,cv981,16679,6,"she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier .",neg
9,cv981,16679,7,do you think you know where this is headed ?,neg
9,cv981,16679,8,"most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second .",neg
9,cv981,16679,9,"if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city .",neg
9,cv981,16679,10,"meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently .",neg
9,cv981,16679,11,"it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .",neg
9,cv981,16679,12,"the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune .",neg
9,cv981,16679,13,"the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining .",neg
9,cv981,16679,14,"usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking . """,neg
9,cv981,16679,15,"when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble .",neg
9,cv981,16679,16,"i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) .",neg
9,cv981,16679,17,"always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing .",neg
9,cv981,16679,18,"nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after .",neg
9,cv981,16679,19,"this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels . """,neg

9,cv982,22209,7,"the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera .",neg
9,cv982,22209,8,"the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course .",neg
9,cv982,22209,9,most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success .,neg
9,cv982,22209,10,"bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted .",neg
9,cv982,22209,11,"the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing .",neg

9,cv992,12806,3,she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .,neg
9,cv992,12806,4,the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .,neg
9,cv992,12806,5,"not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .",neg
9,cv992,12806,6,"it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .",neg
9,cv992,12806,7,"the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .",neg
9,cv992,12806,8,the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .,neg
9,cv992,12806,9,"to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .",neg
9,cv992,12806,10,i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .,neg

9,cv992,12806,12,"if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity .",neg
9,cv992,12806,13,the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .,neg

9,cv992,12806,17,"what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er ,",neg

9,cv992,12806,22,i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .,neg
9,cv992,12806,23,this movie is really stupid .,neg

9,cv992,12806,25,"also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .",neg
9,cv992,12806,26,the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .,neg

9,cv992,12806,32,"the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .",neg
9,cv992,12806,33,"the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .",neg
9,cv992,12806,34,"as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .",neg
9,cv992,12806,35,the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .,neg
9,cv992,12806,36,the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .,neg
9,cv992,12806,37,this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .,neg
9,cv992,12806,38,"maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .",neg
9,cv992,12806,39,"add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .",neg
9,cv992,12806,40,"the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while .",neg
9,cv992,12806,41,it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .,neg
9,cv992,12806,42,the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .,neg
9,cv992,12806,43,the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .,neg
9,cv992,12806,44,the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .,neg
9,cv992,12806,45,"although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people .",neg
9,cv992,12806,46,the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .,neg
9,cv992,12806,47,"however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .",neg
9,cv992,12806,48,"typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind .",neg
9,cv992,12806,49,"the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) .",neg
9,cv992,12806,50,"i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie .",neg

9,cv993,29565,1,"actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .",neg
9,cv993,29565,2,"proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .",neg
9,cv993,29565,3,"face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .",neg

9,cv993,29565,6,terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .,neg

9,cv993,29565,8,"on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .",neg

9,cv995,23113,52,which one is it ?,neg
9,cv995,23113,53,"the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .",neg
9,cv995,23113,54,"furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .",neg

9,cv998,15691,6,"it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,7,the story is simple .,neg
9,cv998,15691,8,"jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .",neg
9,cv998,15691,9,"since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .",neg
9,cv998,15691,10,"it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .",neg
9,cv998,15691,11,my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?,neg
9,cv998,15691,12,"well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .",neg
9,cv998,15691,13,""" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .",neg
9,cv998,15691,14,"in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .",neg
9,cv998,15691,15,"the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .",neg
9,cv998,15691,16,"and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .",neg
9,cv998,15691,17,"there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .",neg
9,cv998,15691,18,"james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .",neg
9,cv998,15691,19,"daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .",neg
9,cv998,15691,20,"and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .",neg
9,cv998,15691,21,"there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .",neg
9,cv998,15691,22,"he has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .",neg
9,cv998,15691,23,"and yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .",neg
9,cv998,15691,24,"i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .",neg

9,cv999,14636,2,"it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature .",neg

9,cv999,14636,4,_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .,neg
9,cv999,14636,5,"the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits .",neg

9,cv999,14636,8,"there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .",neg
9,cv999,14636,9,"that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .",neg
9,cv999,14636,10,"the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends .",neg

9,cv999,14636,19,"granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .",neg
9,cv999,14636,20,that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .,neg
9,cv999,14636,21,"like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .",neg
